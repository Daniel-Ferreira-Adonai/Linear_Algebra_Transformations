# Linear Algebra Transformations

It's me again! :) This is part 2 of a 3-part project where we need to work with computer algebra. Now, we are focusing on transformations. This program includes a series of transformations such as:

-Rotation
-Projection
-Shearing
-Mirroring
-Reflection

I hope this is useful for you. Cheers.
